# Categorical Data Cleaning


The problem statement is that data cleaning of categorical data is tedious due to typos as a result of human-error.

In order to allieviate this, the code calculates the jaccard similarity and outputs the percentage similarity with the correct target text.

You can then key in the cut-off percentage to replace all text above the cut-off. Making data cleaning significantly easier.
